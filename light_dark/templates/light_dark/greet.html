        <h1>Hey {{ name }},
        <br>Do you prefere Light or Dark?</h1>
        <br>When you were here before
            Couldn't look you in the eye
            You're just like an angel
            Your skin makes me cry
            You float like a feather
            In a beautiful world
            <br>I wish I was special
            You're so fuckin' special
            But I'm a creep
            <br>I'm a weirdo
            What the hell am I doin' here?
            I don't belong here
            I don't care if it hurts
            I wanna have control
            I want a perfect body
            I want a perfect soul
            I want you to notice
            When I'm not around
            <br>So fuckin' special
            I wish I was special
            But I'm a creep
            I'm a weirdo
            <br>What the hell am I doin' here?
            I don't belong here
            She's running out the door (run)
            She's running out
            She run, run, run, run,
            Run...
            Whatever makes you happy
            Whatever you want
            You're so fuckin' special
            I wish I was special
            But I'm a creep
            I'm a weirdo
            What the hell am I doin' here?
            I don't belong here
            I don't belong here
